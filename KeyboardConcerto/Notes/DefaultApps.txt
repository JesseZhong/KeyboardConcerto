Default Apps

Description:
	Within Windows 10, the provided Settings app allows users to easily select default apps
	for the most standard app types: 
					Email, Maps, Music Player, Photo Viewer, Video Player, and Web Browser

	These associations are presented clearly in the Settings app, located in SYSTEM > Default apps.
	However, the underlying workings are less elegant. This UI still uses the existing file type
	association system. Just like certain AppKeys (see Issues.txt), the app relies on the default
	app associated with a specific file types or protocols.

	Here is the mapping of app categories:

	Email			MAILTO

	Maps			BINGMAPS

	Music Player	*.mp3

	Photo Viewer	*.jpeg, *.jpg, *.png

	Video Player	*.avi, *.mp4

	Web Browser		*.htm, *.html
